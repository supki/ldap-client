-- | <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.8 Delete> operation.
--
-- This operation comes in four flavours:
--
--   * synchronous, exception throwing ('delete')
--
--   * synchronous, returning 'Either' 'ResponseError' @()@ ('deleteEither')
--
--   * asynchronous, 'IO' based ('deleteAsync')
--
--   * asynchronous, 'STM' based ('deleteAsyncSTM')
--
-- Of those, the first one ('delete') is probably the most useful for the typical usecase.
